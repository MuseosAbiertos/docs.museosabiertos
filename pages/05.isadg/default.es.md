<td>The Department of Railways and Canals existed from 1879 to 1936. It was established on May 15; 1879 (42 Vict. c. 7; s. 4-5); when it assumed responsibilities formerly under the direction of the Department of Public Works. It was dissolved on November 2; 1936 (1 Edw. VIII; c. 34); when its functions were incorporated in the newly created Department of Transport to group together all the federal government’s transport related activities. A Minister of the crown headed the Department; with a Deputy Minister as the chief administrative officer. Initially; it had two branches; the Railway Branch and the Canal Branch; each directed by a Chief Engineer; with the assistance of an accountant and a secretary responsible for record keeping; contracts; and reports. The Railway Branch was responsible for the construction; operation; and maintenance of governmentowned railways and telegraph networks such as the Intercolonial Railway; and the Prince Edward Island Railway and with railway companies with which it had major contracts such as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The Canal Branch was responsible for construction; operation; and maintenance of canals and navigation systems on the Great Lakes and along the St. Lawrence; Ottawa; Trent; and Richelieu Rivers; as well as for the St. Peter’s and Rideau Canals. In addition to its central offices in Ottawa; the Department had a large field service to operate railways and canals. In 1906; a Statistical Branch; which reported to the Comptroller; was created to gather and compile data on canals and railways. Three years later; the department reorganized into five branches; the Secretary’s; Legal; Statistical; Accountant’s; and two Chief Engineers Branches. In 1912; the Office of the Assistant Deputy Minister was created to oversee general administration.</td>
